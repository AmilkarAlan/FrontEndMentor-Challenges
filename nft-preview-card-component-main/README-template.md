## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project I understood the use of SCSS and put it into practice.
Improve the use of CSS-Flex and the positioning of objects.

I read a bit about Z-Index and put it into practice applying it to hover.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I'm going to get better at using pseudoclasses and other design tools.
My next project will include JavaScript.
